static_image_model --> if it is img then true if video then false 
model_complexity --> complexity of the landmark can be 0 or 1 defualt --> 1
min_detection_confidence --> b/w 0.0 and 1 for the hand detection to be successful default --> 0.5
min_tracking_confidence --> b/w 0.0 and 1, ignored if static_image_model is true, for hand to be tracked
