static_image_model --> if it is img then true if video then false 
model_complexity --> complexity of the landmark can be 0 or 1 defualt --> 1
min_detection_confidence --> b/w 0.0 and 1 for the hand detection to be successful default --> 0.5
min_tracking_confidence --> b/w 0.0 and 1, ignored if static_image_model is true, for hand to be tracked 


MATH FILE ---

angle is created at point 6 when index is bent ---> 3 poitns are needed 
a, b, c where b is the union
direction of vectors = arctan(y/x)
arctan2 returns angle between +ve x-axis and vector (x,y) --> 0 and 1 are x and y respectively
